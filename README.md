<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1><br>
<p>- This is a demo application used for displaying keytap on OBS purely for recording osu! gameplay.</p><br>
<p>- I'm doing this project for fun and want to know how to create an application like this.</p><br>
<p>- I'll try to add some necessary function and upload an <strong>.exe</strong> file instead of <strong>.py</strong> file.</p><br>

<h1>TUTORIAL</h1><br>
<p><strong>FOR PYTHON FILE</strong></p><br>
<p>- You need to install python on your computer first and then run it. Easy, end of tutorial. (joking)</p><br>

<br>
<p><strong>FOR .EXE FILE</strong></p><br>
<p>TO BE CONTINUE</p>
